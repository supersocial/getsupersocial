Our goal is to help you organize, find, and use your data to be your most productive self while respecting your privacy and honoring the commitments we've made in our Two Principles of Data Protection.

        <p>SOCIAL CONTACT JOURNAL’S 2 PRINCIPLES OF DATA PROTECTION</p>
        <h2>Your Data is Yours</h2>
        <p>We do not own your data. Putting notes and other content into Social Contact Journal does not change that content's ownership or copyright status. If the data was yours to begin with, it remains yours after you put it in Social Contact Journal. Of course, if the data wasn’t yours to begin with, putting it in Social Contact Journal doesn’t make it yours. This is true of all of our products and services.</p>
        <p>By using our products, you give Social Contact Journal permission to do certain things with your data so that we can run our service. For example, you give us permission to back it up, send it over a network, index it for searching, display it on your various devices, etc. Some of these operations may require us to send your data to partners such as iCloud to provide parts of the Social Contact Journal Service. </p>
        <p>Other than giving us the permission to perform these limited operations so we can run the Social Contact Journal Service, you retain all the rights to your data.</p>

        <h2>Your Data is Protected</h2>
        <p>Everything you put into Social Contact Journal is private by default. We are not a “big data” company and do not try to make money from your content. Our systems automatically analyze your data in order to power Social Contact Journal features, such as search and related notes, and to tell you about important features and products that we think will enhance your Social Contact Journal experience, but we never give or sell your content to any third party for advertising purposes.</p>
        <p>Our business model is simple: we only make money when you decide to pay us for a great product. This means that trust is our biggest asset and keeping your data private is fundamental.</p>
        <p>In addition, we take many precautions to protect your data from accidental loss and theft. Everything you put into an Social Contact Journal is linked to your apple ID.</p>
        <p>For information about our privacy and security practices please read our Privacy Policy. You can read more about your rights and responsibilities in our Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>What information does Social Contact Journal collect? </h2>
        <p>We built Social Contact Journal to help you stay in touch with people you care about. That means you can input, upload, or store in Social Contact Journal any text, images, and other data that you choose—we refer to that information as “Content”. We also collect and receive the following types of information:</p>
        <p>Usage data. We collect and log data on how you and others access and use Social Contact Journal, for example, the act of creating a moment. Usage data may be collected through cookies, and similar technologies. </p>
        <p>Device information. We collect information about the number and type of devices you use to connect to the Service, as well as information about the operating systems on those devices. </p>


        <h2>How does Social Contact Journal use my information?</h2>
        <p>We have specific rules for how and when we use the information we collect and receive. We describe these below.</p>
        <h3>What does Social Contact Journal do with my information?</h3>

Below, we describe the ways in which we use the information we collect and receive to provide, maintain, and improve the Service; to provide troubleshooting and customer support; to protect the Service for all our users; to contact you; and to administer Social Contact Journal premium accounts. </p>
        <p>We use a number of technologies to help you get the most out of the Service. Our systems automatically analyze your data to power Social Contact Journal features and to continually improve the Service for you in a way that does not require anyone to look at your Content. This may include, for example: Making sure you find what you’re looking for when you search your account.
        </p>
        <p>To provide troubleshooting and customer support, our Customer Support team may need to access your information, such as your account email address and information about the Social Contact Journal application you are using, subject to the protections described below.  </p>
        <p>As part of our efforts to protect your account and the functionality of the Service, our systems may analyze the emails you send to and from your Social Contact Journal account and the notes you share to detect spam, malware, or other potential security concerns. If we determine that such material constitutes a Terms of Service or User Guidelines violation, we may block delivery of or unshare the problematic material, much like a spam filter works for your email inbox.</p>
        <p>In accordance with your communication preferences, we’ll occasionally contact you to announce new products and features we build for you, share tips for using Social Contact Journal to get more done, make special offers, and provide information about how Social Contact Journal works with products and services from our business partners.</p>

        <p>You have control over who sees your Content. We limit the use of your Content to make sure that no one at Social Contact Journal can view it unless you expressly give us permission or it’s necessary to comply with our legal obligations. Specifically:</p>
        <p>To help refine or improve the technology, we may ask you for permission to review portions of your Content. For example, if a new feature suggests related moments that are relevant to your Content, we may give you an opportunity to provide us feedback on how well the feature is performing along with a sample of the Content in question, so we can make sure this feature provides appropriately tailored suggestions. Such access to your Content is done only with your express permission and is subject to strict confidentiality rules and data access controls. Choosing to give us such permission is completely voluntary.</p>
        <p>If you contact our Customer Support team for help with specific pieces of Content in your account (for example, if you can’t find a note you believe should be in your account), we may ask for your temporary permission to look at your Content. This permission terminates when the issue is resolved.</p>
        <p>If we become aware of a potential violation of our a Terms of Service or User Guidelines, we may suspend or close your account until the problematic material is removed. Under such a circumstance, we would only look at the Content in your account if you give us consent or if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, including to protect the safety of you or any other person.</p>
        <p>To test and improve our product offerings for our users, we use aggregated data that does not contain any personal information, does not identify any person, and cannot be connected to any specific user. This policy is not intended to apply to such anonymized/de-identified data.</p>
