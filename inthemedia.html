						<h4>1 August 2019</h4>
						<p>Social contact journal helps users to reach out, stay in touch, and remember their conversations. The app allows users to add notes and photos to their contacts. It is a personal CRM so no data will be publicly accessible.</p>
						<p>"I use the app the keep track of the news of my contacts’ lives, so that I won’t forget major events or important knowledge about someone" says Rick – who tried the app for several months. “It helps me to remember that I should ask about only one parent and helps me to be more caring.”</p>
						<p>“As a key account manager, I need to maintain and build relationships. Congratulating on a personal anniversary like their professional qualification seems like nothing, but remembering this makes a great impression on people and we never fall short on things to discuss.” - says Megan. </p>
						<p>Sam, who is an avid traveler, is using the app daily as well. He says “I am happy that the app can remind me to reach out to someone every month, or quarter. It helps me to keep people closer and makes my life easier as I can remember more important details.”</p>
						<p>Social Contact journal is available on the iPhone and iPad. Try it out now and become more social.</p>
